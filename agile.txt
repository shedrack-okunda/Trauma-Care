Step-by-Step Agile Plan for Your Project
🧩 1. Define Your Product Backlog (Features/Tasks)
List out all the features you plan to build. For example:

User Signup/Login

Symptom Checker

Mood Tracker

Mentor Booking

Medication Reminder

Order Medicine

User Dashboard

Admin Panel

Use a tool like Trello, Notion, Jira, or even a Google Sheet.

🌀 2. Break the Project into Sprints (1–2 weeks)
Each sprint focuses on delivering working, testable features. Example:

Sprint 1: Setup frontend + backend structure, build auth

Sprint 2: Build symptom checker + dashboard UI

Sprint 3: Add mentor booking + reminders

Sprint 4: Order medicine + polish UI + deploy

🔁 3. Follow Iterative Cycles
For each sprint:

Plan: Decide features for the sprint

Build: Code those features

Test: Verify functionality

Review: Demo what you built

Improve: Refactor or adjust based on feedback

🧪 4. Continuous Feedback
Get feedback from:

Mentors or bootcamp instructors

Peers

Real users (if possible) Adjust your direction if needed.

 Recovery Tracker: Daily logging, mood/emotion tracking

 Mentor Booking: Book sessions, calendar view

 Medication Reminder: Time-based reminders

 Medicine Ordering: Search + cart + checkout UI

📦 Backend (MERN API setup)
 Set up Express server with TypeScript

 Connect MongoDB (Atlas or local)

 Build RESTful APIs for Users, Symptoms, Mentors, Reminders

📐 UI Design & Flow
